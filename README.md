# About

This project is a demo of some APIs that I like on react-native. I used Expo and some other popular
libraries to make this app, check out the expo deployed demo.

## Features

I took advantage of the things that are exclusive in mobile and embedded development. So in this project you will find a full redux flow integrated w. SQLite to hook up a standard note app. SQLite is great because it allows for larger data sets to be stored/processed on the device to be used later. A good example of a company doing this is Strava, they store GPS points locally when on a ride or a run and upload the point later.

Another feature I used was the pedometer available in most devices, using this in combination w/ things like GPS helps apps like Google Maps to determine if one is in a car, or walking. This is very unique to mobile development.

These features amongst many others are why mobile development is so appealing to me. Hope you like the demo!
